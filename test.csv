County Public Health Updated Directives: March 17,"

### Article Date: Tuesday, March 17, 2020

​Facts about COVID-19:  


  * ​As we have had more extensive experience with COVID-19, it is clear that a significant majority of those infected have no or only mild symptoms.
  * With additional testing, the number of cases of COVID-19 are growing.
  * The vast majority of these cases are now the result of community spread. 
  * Public health team efforts have been focused on identifying persons with COVID-19, separating them from others, and tracking down persons who were exposed to the infected person. This containment strategy helped to slow the introduction of the virus, but has to be redirected to address the larger number of cases in the region. 
  * Public health staff have shifted their efforts to community mitigation measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect those who are most vulnerable to severe illness. 
  * Although community mitigation measures can be disruptive, these recommendations are to protect the public’s health. 



  


**COVID-19 is affecting us all and we are all in this together. The goal for all of us is to protect those who are the most vulnerable from exposure to carriers of COVID-19. We recognize that it would not be possible to list all the essential sites or command how individuals and businesses must carry out these directives. Individuals and employers need to weigh the risk of exposure to the public and operating as usual. In summary, effective immediately and until further notice, Sacramento County public health officials direct the public, to the best of their abilities, implement the following:**

​  


  *  **​Workplaces:**
    * Workplaces and businesses should implement telecommuting and teleconferencing for their employees, where appropriate and feasible.
    * Only those employees performing essential duties that cannot be performed by telecommuting should physically come to work



  


  *  **​Vulnerable Populations:**   

    * Those aged 65 and older and/or those with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart disease, or lung diseases such as COPD, as well as those with severely weakened immune systems are at highest risk of complications. 
    * People at higher risk should stay home and away from gatherings of unrelated individuals
    * Those in the vulnerable populations can go outside (to walk the dog, go on walks or go to the park) provided they are at least six feet from others  

    * This guidance exempts individuals who work in essential services, such as hospital and health care workers, pharmacists, peace officers, firefighters, staff at skilled nursing facilities and residential care facilities for the elderly, and other essential workers.  




 **  
**

  *  **​Less Vulnerable Populations:**
    * All those ​at lower risk should stay home to the maximum extent possible except when going to essential sites



 **  
**

  *  **Essential sites INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO​:**
    * Health Care Facilities
    * Grocery stores
    * Pharmacies
    * Hardware stores/plumbers/electricians for emergency services
    * Businesses that provide food, shelter and social services, and other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individuals
    * Newspapers, television, radio and other media services
    * Gas Stations and auto supply, auto repair and related facilities
    * Banks and related financial institutions
    * Plumbers, electricians, exterminators and others who provide services that are necessary to maintaining the safety, sanitation and essential operation of residences
    * Airlines, taxis and other public and private transportation providers  

    * Agriculture, including ​food processing and distribution​  




 **  
**

  *  **Gathering Places:**
    * No gatherings in any formal setting
    * All bars, wineries and brew-pubs should be closed
    * All in-dining at restaurants should cease; take out and home delivery (with social distancing) may continue
    * All gyms should be closed 
    * All bingo halls and card rooms should be closed



 **​  
**

  *  **Schools:**
    * All Sacramento schools are closed 



**  
**

  * **Sick Persons:**
    * Everyone should stay home if they are sick until they have had no fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms for at least 72 hours after symptoms resolve, or 7 days from when symptoms began, whichever is longer.
    * Anyone who lives with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days.
    * Those with cold-like symptoms who can manage their symptoms at home with over-the-​counter-drugs should do so, regardless of whether they have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19. 
      * If, however, difficulty breathing and lethargy develops, or symptoms were better and then got worse, they should call their healthcare provider, or urgent care center ahead so they can prepare to take care of them. 
      * People should only call 911 or go to an emergency department if they believe that they are extremely sick or their life is in imminent danger. Other emergencies are still occurring, and emergency resources must be available to address all of them, not just COVID-19



 **  
**

  *  **Masks:** Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask. 
    * CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. 
    * Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility).

County Proclaims Public Health Emergency,"

### Article Date: Thursday, March 5, 2020

Page Content

​Sacramento County is proclaiming today a public health emergency and a local emergency in order to ensure appropriate resources and funding are available to the County in its response to COVID-19, also known as 2019 novel coronavirus.  


  


The proclamations of a public health emergency and local emergency do not signify an increased risk to the residents of Sacramento County. A proclamation of emergency allows the County to provide or receive mutual aid from other jurisdictions and assists in opening up available resources, mutual aid and staffing. 

  


The proclamations follow the State of California’s proclamation of emergency on March 4 regarding COVID-19 and the funding that would be made available. Proclaiming a local emergency is a prerequisite for requesting and receiving any available federal or state funding.

  


“Our intent in proclaiming a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure uninterrupted access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission,” said Phil Serna, Chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. “The proclamation should not be considered a reason for elevated concern; in fact, it is quite the opposite as it helps us in our mission to contain the virus.”

  


The County continues to work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations, and providing guidance and assistance to health providers in monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for laboratory testing and confirming infection.

  


While there is no vaccine for COVID-19, there are ways to minimize risk from respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19:

  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
  * Stay home when you are sick.
  * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
  * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Sacramento County Reports a COVID-19 Death,"

### Article Date: Tuesday, March 10, 2020

Page Content

​​Sacramento County Public Health reports that a resident in their 90s, in an assisted living facility with an underlying health condition, has died of complications of COVID-19. 

“We extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of this individual,” said Sacramento County Department of Health Services Director, Dr. Peter Beilenson. “We will all work to protect our most vulnerable residents from exposure to communicable diseases.  


  


“When a nursing home facility has an outbreak, regardless if it is flu, norovirus or COVID-19, Sacramento County Public Health immediately begins the investigation process to follow the communicable disease exposure of others, and will monitor or isolate those individuals until they are no longer contagious,” said Dr. Beilenson. 

  


“Additionally, these facilities follow a flu outbreak plan, such as, limiting visitor access, freezing new admissions to the facility, closing common areas and enhanced cleaning measures.”

  


To protect those most vulnerable from exposure to COVID-19 it is critical to adhere to these recommendations:

  


  * Urge those age 60 and older and anyone with an underlying medical condition to stay away from large gatherings.
  * If you have any cold-like symptoms, do not have any contact, or at least maintain a six feet distance, with anyone in the high risk category (60 and older and/or those with medical conditions). 
  * Wash your hands often and be sure to practice good hand washing techniques.
  * Do not touch your face unless you have washed your hands. 
  * If someone in the high risk category, develops any difficulty breathing, or was feeling better but then feel a lot worse, they should call their health care provider or urgent care so they can prepare to take care of them. People should only call 911 if they feel they are in imminent danger.
  * Stay home to reduce the exposure to others for at least 72 hours after symptoms resolve or a total of 7 days – whichever is longer.



  


For health confidentiality, in compliance with HIPAA, Sacramento County Public Health does not release location information of individuals.

County Announces New Mitigation Efforts: COVID-19,"

### Article Date: Monday, March 9, 2020

Page Content

​Sacramento County announced today that it will shift its effort to community mitigation measures that will slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community, protect those who are most vulnerable to severe illness, and allow our health care system to prepare resources to take care of severely ill patients. These new measures will include cessation of 14-day quarantines and contact tracing for individuals who may​ have had possible exposure to individuals with​ COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms​​.  


  


The following recommendations are effective immediately, and will extend through March 31, 2020:  


  *  **Quarantine** : With the shift from containment to mitigation, it is no longer necessary for someone who has been in contact with someone with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days if they are not showing symptoms. This applies to the general public, as well as health care workers and first responders. However, if they develop respiratory symptoms, they should stay home in order to protect those who are well. 



  


  * **Sick Persons** : 
    * People should stay home if they are sick.
    * Those with cold-like symptoms who can manage their symptoms at home with over-the-counter drugs should do so, regardless of whether they have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19. 
      * If, however, difficulty breathing and lethargy develops, or symptoms were better and then got worse, they should call their healthcare provider, or urgent care center ahead so they can prepare to take care of them. 
      * People should only call 911 or go to an emergency department if they believe that they are extremely sick or their life is in imminent danger. Other emergencies are still occurring, and emergency resources must be available to address all of them, not just COVID-19



  


  *  **Vulnerable Populations** : People at higher risk should consider staying home and away from crowded social gatherings where people are within arm’s length, such as parades, conferences, sporting events and concerts.
    *  **Age** : Risk of severe disease from COVID-19 escalates as age increases. Persons over age 80 are in the highest risk category. 
    * **Underlying Conditions** : People with chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart disease, or lung diseases such as COPD, as well as those with severely weakened immune systems are at high risk of complications.   




  


  * **Workplaces** : Workplaces and businesses may consider implementing telecommuting and teleconferencing for their employees, where appropriate and feasible.  




  


  *  **Schools** : Schools that have a COVID-19 exposure or case should be in close collaboration with the local health department and County Office of Education regarding appropriate next steps. 



  


  * **Masks** : Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask. 
    * CDC does **not** recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. 
    * Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility). 



  


Currently, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sacramento County stand at 10 people with one recovered, including an elementary school-aged student in Elk Grove, whose test came back positive today.

"SacCounty Follows CDC Lead: Gatherings, Mitigation","

### Article Date: Thursday, March 12, 2020

Page Content

​Based on guidance released yesterday from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Sacramento County announced today its recommendation that non-essential gatherings with more than 250 people should be postponed or canceled at least until the end of March in order to slow the transmission of COVID-19. Smaller events may proceed if organizers can implement social distancing of six feet per person.   


  


This announcement follows the CDC and CDPH [guidelines to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). The CDC’s mitigation guidelines are in line with Sacramento County’s contact tracing reduction for individuals who may have had possible exposure to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms.

  


The California State Department of Public Health (CDPH) defines a “gathering” as “any event or convening that brings together people in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, cafeteria, or any other indoor or outdoor space.” [The CDPH policy, which defines essential and non-essential gatherings, can be found here](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf). 

  


At this time, Sacramento County’s level of community transmission or impact of COVID-19 is “minimal to moderate.” Sacramento County is recommending CDC mitigation guidelines for that category:

  


 **Individuals and Families at Home:**

  * ​Continue to practice personal protective measures, such as: 
    * Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds 
    * Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
    * Avoid close contact with people who are sick
    * If a person is showing symptoms—fever, cough, shortness of breath, they are advised to stay home for a minimum of seven days from the start of symptoms.
  * Gatherings of individuals who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people. This includes gatherings such as those at retirement facilities, assisted living facilities, developmental homes, and support groups for people with health conditions. People at higher risk for COVID-19 complications are adults who are 60 years or older and individuals with several chronic medical conditions like heart, lung, or kidney disease.
  * Continue to monitor local information about COVID-19 in your community. Visit [Sacramento County’s COVID-19 webpage​](https://www.saccounty.net/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx). ​



  


 **​Schools:**  


  * ​Implement social distancing measures:
    * Reduce the frequency or postpone large gatherings (e.g. assemblies) and limit the number of attendees per gathering.
    * Alter schedules to reduce mixing (e.g. stagger recess, entry/dismissal times)
    * Limit inter-school interactions
    * ​Consider distance or e-learning in some settings
  * Short-term dismissals for school and extracurricular activities as needed for cleaning and contract tracing.
  * Students at increased risk of severe illness should consider implementing individual plans for distance learning, e-learning.



  


 **Workplace:**

  * ​Encourage staff to telework (when feasible), particularly individuals at increased risk of severe illness.
  * Implement social distancing measures
    * Increase physical space between workers at the worksite
    * Stagger work schedules
    * Decrease social contacts in the workplace (e.g. limit in-person meetings, meeting for lunch in a break room, etc.)
  * Limit large work-related gatherings (e.g. staff meetings, after work functions)
  * Limit non-essential work travel



  


 **Community and Faith-Based Organizations:**

  * ​Implement social distancing measures:
    * Determine ways to continue to provide support services to individuals at increased risk of severe disease (services, meals, checking in) while limiting group settings and exposures.
    * Cancel large gatherings (e.g., more than 250 people) or move to smaller groupings.
    * Small gatherings held in venues that do not allow social distancing of six feet per person should be postponed or canceled. This includes gatherings in crowded auditoriums, rooms or other venues.
    * For organizations that serve high-risk populations, cancel gatherings of more than 10 people.



  


 **Healthcare Settings and Healthcare Providers:**

  * ​Implement changes to visitor policies to further limit exposures to healthcare personnel, residents, and patients. Changes could include temperature/symptom checks for visitors, limiting visitor movement in the facility, etc.
  * Implement triage before entering facilities (e.g. parking lot triage, front door), phone triage and telemedicine to limit unnecessary healthcare visits.
  * Actively monitor absenteeism and respiratory illness among healthcare personnel and patients.
  * Actively monitor personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies.
  * Establish processes to evaluate and test large numbers of patients and healthcare professionals with respiratory symptoms.
  * Consider allowing asymptomatic exposed healthcare personnel to work while wearing a facemask.
  * Begin to cross-train healthcare professionals for working in other units in anticipation of staffing shortages.



  


 **Public Health Departments:**

  * May reduce contact tracing if resources dictate, prioritizing those in high-risk settings (e.g. healthcare professionals or high-risk settings based on vulnerable populations or critical infrastructure).
  * Continue COVID-19 testing of symptomatic persons; however, if testing capacity limited, prioritize testing of high-risk individuals.
  * Encourage healthcare professionals to more strictly implement phone triage and telemedicine practices.

Coronavirus Update and Reminder About the Flu,"

### Article Date: Thursday, January 30, 2020

Page Content

​[Sacramento County Public Health](https://dhs.saccounty.net/PUB/Pages/PUB-Home.aspx) is closely monitoring the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus, now named ""Covid-19."". **Currently, there are no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Sacramento County, and the exposure risk of Covid-19 remains low.**

Working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the local medical community, Sacramento County Public Health has a plan in place to identify, isolate, test and investigate any potential cases of Covid-19 in Sacramento County.

Sacramento County Health Officer, Dr. Olivia Kasirye, reminds residents, “Currently the risk of exposure to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) is low. Community healthcare providers are monitoring for acute respiratory illness cases and gathering recent travel information for specimen testing per CDC guidance. Like we do for other reportable communicable diseases, we are prepared and are conducting surveillance on this new virus strain.”

  


>  **Not all “Coronaviruses” are the same**
> 
> Don’t confuse the category of “coronaviruses” with the strain named “2019 Novel Coronavirus.” The Covid-19 is just one [type of coronavirus​](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html). Other strains of human coronaviruses are common and cause mild-to-moderate respiratory illness every year, such as the common cold. If you see the term “Coronavirus” on your lab results, this is NOT the Covid-19 strain, as this testing is only done by the CDC and would be coordinated by Sacramento County Public Health. Additionally, Sacramento County Public Health would announce a confirmed Covid-19 cases in Sacramento County.

  


Symptoms of Covid-19 are very similar to the flu, including runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. 

To help prevent the spread of Covid-19, practice every day preventative actions:

  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
  * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
  * Stay home when you are sick.
  * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
  * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
  * People experiencing worsening flu symptoms should seek medical attention – call ahead if recently traveled to China or have had contact with a person with confirmed Covid-19 while they were ill. 



While the Covid-19 is concerning, what poses a much greater and more imminent risk in our community is the flu virus. According to the CDC, the flu virus caused roughly 61,000 flu deaths in the U.S. in the 2017-18 season.

  


You can protect yourself, your family and the community from getting the flu, simply by getting the flu shot. It’s quick, it’s easy, it’s not too late and the​ shot provides the best protection against getting the flu.

Page Content

 **​​​2/27/2020 ​Update:** On Feb. 26, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced that Sacramento County coordinated the healthcare of an individual from another county who has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in isolation. The individual has no history of travel to China and no known contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Sacramento County Public Health is working closely with state and federal health agencies to determine the source of the individual’s infection and is conducting contact investigations. 

_​​_

 **2/21/2020**

 _First confirmed Sacramento County COVID-19 case;_ _no immediate threat to the public’s health_

Sacramento, Calif. – Sacramento County Public Health reports the first confirmed travel-related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in a Sacramento Coun​ty resident. The individual recently traveled from China, where an outbreak of the novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019.  


  


The adult returned from China to the U.S. on February 2. The individual took precautionary measures during travel and has self-quarantined since returning. During the quarantine period, the individual began exhibiting mild symptoms. In consultation with the individual’s primary care provider, Sacramento County Public Health coordinated testing with the CDC and the CDPH. Currently, the individual is asymptomatic, but will remain home for mandatory isolation until cleared by Sacramento County Public Health. Sacramento County Public Health’s investigation determined that currently, the public’s risk of exposure is extremely low.

  


As a reminder to residents of Sacramento County, Dr. Peter Beilenson, Sacramento County Department of Health Services Director, said, “Cases in the U.S., including this first case in Sacramento County, have primarily been travel-related. The risk of COVID-19 to the U.S. public continues to be low. Sacramento County health providers are continuing to be vigilant, monitoring for acute respiratory illness, and gathering recent travel information to detect any new COVID-19 cases.”

  


With state and federal health agencies, Sacramento County Public Health has a coordinated system with healthcare partners to identify possible cases, coordinate testing/diagnosis and management of suspect cases, lead investigations to identify those possibly exposed for infection control. Per guidance from the CDC, a clinical specimen was collected from the individual and was sent to CDC where laboratory testing confirmed the infection.  


  


Daily Precautions:

While the immediate risk of this new virus to the public is currently low, there are simple daily precautions that everyone should always take. CDPH and Sacramento County Public Health recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

  * It’s flu season, get vaccinated – it’s not too late. 
  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
  * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
  * Stay home when you are sick.​  

  * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
  * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
  * ​People experiencing worsening flu symptoms should seek medical attention – call ahead if recently traveled to China or have had contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 while they were ill.
